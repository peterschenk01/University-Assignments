### Answer for 2 c

- The body rotates about the **z-axis** because  
  **ω = (0, 0, 3)**.

- A point’s rotational speed depends on its distance from the **rotation axis**, not from the center of mass.

- Distances from the z-axis:  
  - P: 2  
  - Q: 2  
  → Both have the **same rotational speed** (6 m/s).

- Total velocity is  
  **v = v_cm + ω × r**

- For **P**, the rotational velocity points mostly in the same direction as the center-of-mass velocity → speeds add → **5.39 m/s**

- For **Q**, the rotational velocity partly cancels the center-of-mass velocity → lower speed → **4.12 m/s**

**Conclusion:**  
P moves faster because its rotational motion adds to the translational motion, while Q’s partially cancels. Distance from the CM does not determine speed — distance from the rotation axis does.
